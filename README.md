# Kindai-OCR
OCR system for recognizing modern Japanese magazines

## About

This repo contains an OCR sytem for converting modern Japanese images to text.
This is a result of N2I project[http://codh.rois.ac.jp/collaboration/#n2i] for digitization of modern Japanese documents.

The system has 2 main modules: text line extraction and text line recognition. The overall architechture is shown in the below figure.

For text line extraction, we retrain the CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection) on our dataset.
For text line recognition, we employ the attention-based encoder-decoder on our previous publication.
